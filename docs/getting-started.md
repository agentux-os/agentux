# Getting started

This guide takes you from installing AgentUX to a first run that ends in a pull request. AgentUX is pre-release: expect rough edges, and see the [roadmap](../README.md#roadmap) for what is not validated yet.

## 1. Install

AgentUX is a bootc image on Fedora Atomic (Kinoite, KDE Plasma). There are two ways to get it; both are described in full in the [agentux-os README](https://github.com/agentux-os/agentux-os#install).

**From the ISO.** Download `agentux-<date>-x86_64.iso` from a successful run of the [Build ISO](https://github.com/agentux-os/agentux-os/actions/workflows/iso.yml) workflow, check it against its `.sha256`, write it to a USB stick and boot it. The installer asks for the disk, language, time zone and your account.

**From an existing Fedora Atomic or bootc system.**

```sh
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/agentux-os/agentux:latest
systemctl reboot
```

Either way the system tracks `ghcr.io/agentux-os/agentux:latest` and updates from it. If an update breaks something, `sudo bootc rollback` (or the previous entry in the boot menu) brings back the image you had.

## 2. First login

**The agent CLIs install themselves per user.** On your first login, a user service (`agentux-first-login.service`) installs Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity CLI, the ACP adapters and the `mise`-managed dev tools (`bun`, `lazygit`, `ast-grep`, `yq`) into your home, so each CLI can keep itself up to date. It needs the network and downloads a few GB (the Antigravity ACP server alone is about 1 GB unpacked), so give it a few minutes. Follow it with:

```sh
journalctl --user -u agentux-first-login.service -f
```

If something fails, it retries and runs again on the next login. When it has succeeded it writes `~/.local/state/agentux/first-login.done`; delete that file and log in again to repeat it.

**Log in to each vendor CLI yourself.** AgentUX never handles credentials: each harness uses the login or API key you set up for it, and inference is billed by that provider. Open a terminal (Meta+Return opens Konsole) and start each CLI you want to use once, following its sign-in:

```sh
claude      # Claude Code
codex       # Codex
opencode    # OpenCode
agy         # Antigravity CLI
```

You only need the vendors your pipeline uses. The default pipeline uses Claude Code for the planner and implementer and Codex for the reviewer (see [the `agentux.yaml` section](#5-agentuxyaml)).

**The daemon and the cockpit are already running.** `agentuxd` runs as a systemd user service for every user, and the AgentUX Cockpit starts at login. Meta+A opens (or brings forward) the cockpit at any time.

## 3. Cockpit tour

The cockpit is a single window over every agent session the daemon runs. Projects are in the sidebar; `[` and `]` cycle through them.

- **Run board** (`B`). The runs of the selected project, by stage: planned, implementing, testing, in review, waiting for you, done. **New run** (`N`) asks for a directory inside a git repository and a prompt. Open a run to see its sessions, steps and **Cancel run**.
- **Session view.** Each role's session — messages, tool calls, diffs, plans and permission requests — rendered the same way whatever the vendor. The composer sends your message into the live session, handled after its current turn.
- **Approvals inbox** (`I`). Everything waiting for you, from every run: plan approvals, agents' permission requests, budget overruns and agents' questions. `J`/`K` move through it, `A` approves, `D` denies, `1`–`9` picks an answer to a question.
- **Agent bus** (`M`). Messages, review requests and handoffs between agents, grouped by exchange with their turn count, plus questions to you and your answers. The bus composer posts as you to a role, one session or the whole run.
- **Terminal mode** (`T`). Toggles the session view between the structured view and the harness's own TUI, resuming the same conversation (Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode). While you are in the TUI the session is marked **attached** and the daemon queues its turns; when you leave, the agent continues with everything said in the TUI ([ADR 0007](adr/0007-terminal-mode-is-a-session-handoff.md)). Harnesses that cannot resume get a shell in the run's worktree, with a banner saying why. **Shell in worktree** opens a shell in an active run's worktree. While a terminal has the keyboard, the cockpit's shortcuts are off; `Shift+Esc` or `Ctrl+]` gives the keyboard back.
- **Status bar.** Tokens and cost per run, project and vendor, for harnesses that report them.

Press `?` in the cockpit for the full list of shortcuts.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `B` / `I` / `M` | Run board / approvals inbox / agent bus |
| `N` | New run |
| `A` / `D` | Approve / deny the focused request |
| `1`–`9` | Answer an agent's question |
| `J` / `K` | Next / previous in the inbox |
| `T` | Toggle terminal mode |
| `Shift+Esc`, `Ctrl+]` | Leave the terminal |
| `[` / `]` | Previous / next project |
| `?` | All shortcuts |

Desktop-wide: **Meta+A** opens the cockpit, **Meta+Return** opens Konsole.

## 4. `aux` quick reference

`aux` is the cockpit's terminal twin and talks to the same daemon, so it works over SSH and both stay in sync. `aux --help` and `aux <command> --help` have the details.

```sh
# Runs
aux run [project-dir] --prompt "Add a health endpoint"   # start a run; prints its id
aux run --issue 42                     # from an issue on the project's forge
aux run . --prompt "..." --watch       # start and follow it (--title sets the title)
aux ps                                 # active runs and requests waiting for you
aux ps --all                           # finished runs too
aux watch <run-id>                     # history, then live events (bus included) until the run ends
aux cancel <run-id>                    # stop a run; its worktree and branch are kept

# Decisions
aux approve <request-id> [-m note]     # a plan, a step, a budget overrun, or a permission
aux deny <request-id> [-m reason]      # a denied permission tells the agent no; other denials fail the run
aux answer <request-id> <answer...>    # answer an agent's question (one of its options, or free text)

# Talking to agents
aux say <session-id> <text...>         # message a live session, after its current turn
aux bus <run-id>                       # the run's agent bus log
aux bus <run-id> --post role:reviewer <text...>   # post as you; to: role:<name>, session:<id> or run
aux bus <run-id> --post session:<id> --reply-to <message-id> <text...>

# Terminal mode
aux attach <session-id>                # the session in its harness's own TUI; Ctrl-] detaches
aux attach <session-id> --shell        # a shell in the run's worktree instead

# Pipelines and harnesses
aux validate [path]                    # check agentux.yaml (file or project dir); without one, show the default
aux exec --harness <id> [--cwd <dir>] "<prompt>"   # one prompt to claude-code, codex, opencode or antigravity
```

Session ids appear in `aux watch` (`session <id> started: <role> (<harness>) ...`) and in the cockpit's session view; request ids in `aux ps`.

Every command takes `--socket <path>` to talk to a daemon other than the default (`$AGENTUX_SOCKET`, else `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/agentux/agentuxd.sock`).

## 5. `agentux.yaml`

A project can declare its pipeline in `agentux.yaml` at the repository root ([ADR 0005](adr/0005-agentux-yaml.md)). Without one, AgentUX uses the built-in default below, with the `lint` and `test` checks detected from the project (justfile recipes, Cargo, npm scripts, pytest/ruff via uv, Go); if none are detected, the gate step is left out. `aux validate` shows what applies to a project.

Validation is strict: unknown keys fail with their line and column, and every rule violation is reported with its field path. This is the built-in default, annotated:

```yaml
version: 1                    # required; 1 is the only supported version

# Roles map to harnesses: claude-code, codex, opencode or antigravity (experimental).
roles:
  implementer:
    harness: claude-code
  reviewer:
    harness: codex            # a different vendor than the implementer
  planner:
    harness: claude-code
    model: opus               # optional; selected if the harness offers a model choice over ACP

# Commands gate steps run with `sh -c` inside the run's worktree. Names must be unique.
checks:
  - name: lint
    run: just lint
  - name: test
    run: just test

# Step types are fixed: plan, implement, gate, review, pull_request, custom.
pipeline:
  - step: plan                # fields: role, approve
    role: planner
    approve: true             # wait for the human before implementing
  - step: implement           # fields: role, approve
    role: implementer
  - step: gate                # fields: checks, on_fail, max_attempts
    checks: [lint, test]
    on_fail: implement        # loop back with the failure output...
    max_attempts: 3           # ...at most this many times (a loop needs its limit)
  - step: review              # fields: role, approve, on_changes_requested, max_rounds
    role: reviewer
    on_changes_requested: implement
    max_rounds: 2
  - step: pull_request        # fields: draft, approve
    draft: false
    approve: false            # true = wait for the human before opening the PR
  # A custom step sends its own prompt to a role (fields: role, prompt, approve):
  # - step: custom
  #   role: reviewer
  #   prompt: Check the changelog mentions this change.

# Agent bus limits (ADR 0004).
bus:
  max_turns_per_exchange: 6   # at least 1
  # Tools agents may use. Leaving `allow` out allows all six: these five and read_messages.
  allow: [post_message, request_review, handoff, get_run_state, ask_human]

budget:
  max_usd_per_run: 10         # pause the run and ask the human when exceeded
```

Loops (`on_fail`, `on_changes_requested`) must point to exactly one earlier step that runs an agent. Credentials never go in this file.

## 6. Troubleshooting

**The cockpit window is blank, flickers or crashes on start.** The cockpit renders with the system WebKitGTK, which has GPU quirks with some drivers (the NVIDIA proprietary driver and some virtual GPUs). Try:

```sh
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 agentux-cockpit    # most common fix
WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 agentux-cockpit   # last resort: no accelerated compositing
```

To make one permanent for your user, put it in a file under `~/.config/environment.d/` (for example `~/.config/environment.d/cockpit.conf` containing `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1`) and log in again.

**The cockpit shows a "Mock data" badge and "agentuxd is not running".** The cockpit could not reach the daemon and is showing sample data; it reloads by itself once the daemon is up. Check the service:

```sh
systemctl --user status agentuxd.service
journalctl --user -u agentuxd.service
systemctl --user restart agentuxd.service
aux ps                                   # fails if nothing answers on the socket
```

The socket is `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/agentux/agentuxd.sock`; the daemon's state is in `~/.local/state/agentux/agentuxd.db`.

**A CLI is not found.** First login may still be running or may have failed: see `journalctl --user -u agentux-first-login.service`. The per-user tools live in `~/.local/bin` and mise's shims, which login shells, user services and apps started from Plasma all have on their `PATH`.

**An agent step fails at once.** Usually the harness is not logged in: run the CLI by hand once (section 2). `aux exec --harness <id> "say hello"` tries one prompt against a harness outside any run.

**Try the whole flow without real agents.** `aux daemon --fake-agents` runs a daemon whose agent steps are answered by a scripted fake (gates still run the real commands), so nothing is billed. Run it on its own socket and database, next to the real daemon:

```sh
export AGENTUX_SOCKET=/tmp/agentux-demo/agentuxd.sock
aux daemon --fake-agents --database /tmp/agentux-demo/agentuxd.db &

mkdir /tmp/demo-repo && cd /tmp/demo-repo
git init && git -c user.name=Demo -c user.email=demo@example.invalid commit --allow-empty -m init
aux run . --prompt "Add a health endpoint"
aux ps                                   # approve the plan with: aux approve <request-id>
```

To watch it in the cockpit, quit the running cockpit first (it is single-instance, so a second launch would only bring the old window forward), then start it from the same shell, with `AGENTUX_SOCKET` still set: `agentux-cockpit &`. Without a GitHub `origin`, the run ends with `PR skipped` and a reason instead of a pull request.
